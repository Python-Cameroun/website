      <h2 > Speak at PyCon</h2> 
        
        <p>PyCon is seeking speakers of all experience levels and backgrounds to contribute to our conference program! If you use Python professionally, as a hobbyist, or are just excited about Python or programming and open source communities, we'd love to hear from you. Speakers also get prioritized access to financial aid, so please don't let that be a deterrent either! We want you and your ideas at PyCon!</p>
        
        <p>We've got lots of good information and resources below that you should read, but in case you've already read it and want to dive in now.</p>
        
<p>Here are the PyCon 2018 Call for Proposals deadlines:</p>
        
        Tutorial proposals — deadline is 24 November 2017 23:59:59 pm  GMT.
        
        Talk, Poster, and Education Summit proposals — deadline is 3 December 2017 2017 23:59:59 pm  GMT.
        
        
        <p>Where to submit your proposal </p><h3 class="text-center"> All proposal should be sent to : <span class="text-primary">pycameroon@gmail.com</span></h3>
        <p>
        
        Due to the competitive selection process, we encourage prospective speakers to submit their proposals as early as possible as it allows for feedback prior to the CFP deadline.</p>
        
        Guidelines for Proposal Submission
        
        Everyone is encouraged to submit a proposal, regardless of experience level. PyCon thrives on having talks ranging from introductory to advanced. If you are reading this, and you are interested in speaking at PyCon, we want you to submit a proposal.

            <div class="sclp"  id="two">
            <h2 >Talks</h2>
        
        <p>These are the traditional talk sessions given during the main conference days, Friday through Sunday, january 28–May 29.</p>
        
        <p>PyCon is dedicated to featuring a diverse and inclusive mix of speakers in the lineup.</p>
        <p>
        All speakers are expected to have read and adhere to the conference Code of Conduct. In particular for speakers: slide contents and spoken material should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate, and neither are language or imagery that denigrate or demean people based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, or body size. </p>

        
        <p>
        We will make every effort to provide accommodations for speakers and attendees of all abilities—all we ask is that you let us know so we can prepare accordingly.</p>
        <p>
        Most talks are 30 minutes long, but we do offer a limited number of 45-minute slots for important topics that promise to benefit from a more extensive treatment. We organize the schedule into five "tracks", grouping talks by topic and having them in the same room for consecutive sessions.</p>
        <p>
        There is no official restriction on the topic that you propose for a talk session. Talks about Python or the Python community are most likely to line up with the interests of PyCon's audience, and a key consideration that the talk selection committee will be thinking about is your talk’s ability to draw an audience. We observe a limit of one talk per presenter. You may propose more than one, but the committee will ask you to choose only one talk if more than one of your proposals is accepted.
</p></div><hr>
<h2>Tutorials</h2>
        <p>
        As with the talks, we are looking for tutorials that can grow this community at any level. We aim for tutorials that will advance Python, advance this community, and shape the future. Each tutorial session runs for 3 full hours plus a break for coffee. There is both a morning tutorial session and an afternoon tutorial session on the two days preceding the main conference — this year, the tutorial days are Wednesday and Thursday, january 23–26 in the same venue that hosts the main conference days that follow.</p>
        
        
        <p>As tutorials are longer than talks and are in an interactive classroom-like setting, they require much more preparation. Due to the amount of work involved, tutorial instructors are compensated. There is a limit of at most two tutorials given by one presenter.</p>
