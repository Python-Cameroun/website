                <p>Python Cameroon is a Cameroon-based organization representing the various chapters of Python users. We organise meet-ups and events for software developers, students, academics and anyone who wants to learn the python programing language, software development etc. One of our aims is to help grow and diversify the Python community in Cameroon. We also develop and foster links with other Python based communities overseas.

          <h2>Code Of Conduct </h2>
          
          The Python community is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences great successes and continued growth. When you’re working with members of the community, we encourage you to follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep Python a positive, successful, and growing community.
          
          A member of the Python community is:
          
          <h3>Open</h3>
          
          Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it’s on PEPs, patches, problems, or otherwise. We’re receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts. We’re accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.
          
          <h3>Considerate</h3>
          
          Members of the community are considerate of their peers — other Python users. We’re thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community. We’re attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we’re tactful when approaching differing views.
          
          <h3>Respectful</h3>
          
          Members of the community are respectful. We’re respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We’re respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Python community. We’re respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
          
          Overall, we’re good to each other. We contribute to this community not because we have to, but because we want to. If we remember that, these guidelines will come naturally.

            <small><b>Start Date:</b> To be communicated</small><br>
            The project will give training in coding to 21 people  aged 12 - 25. Selected students will be taken from Forms 1 to Upper-sixth classes in low-income public schools. The Python Cameroon community would provide trainers for the entire duration of the training. The trainers are volunteers from the Cameroon Python community and have had their profile checked to verify their competence in passing on computer skills/programming knowledge to the students. In addition, with the help of the Python Software Foundation , Python Cameroon would provide the students with Raspberry Pi’s to facilitate learning during and after the training program. The Python Cameroon is one of 3 organizations supporting this initiative.
